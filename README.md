# calendarCL
Using the google calendar API to create events through the command line. 

# How to Use 
My credentials.json file is not in here for obvious reasons. 
1. To get your own go to https://developers.google.com/calendar & enable your google calendar API & put it in your working directory. 
2. Install the Google Client Library: ```python pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib```
3. Run the sample file: ```python quickstart.py```

## Note
The ```quickstart.py``` is from this link: https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python this is just to test to make sure your credentials are working and you have access to your google calendar. I did not write this code myself.
